            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Shreyas DA, a prefinal year student pursuing my studies at NIE, Mysore. I have a passion for
                technology and enjoy exploring new fields within computer science. My areas of interest include Machine
                Learning, Databases, Backend Development and I genuinely love to explore fundamental Computer Science
                concepts. At the moment, I'm working on projects involving Machine Learning and Django Web Framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up, I was always that silent kid in the class, with good memory and quick learning ability. By
                the age of 5, I knew the capital cities of all the Indian states, which developed a passion for learning
                and made me a Quiz Fanatic. I have participated in numerous Quiz competitions and have won prizes at
                various levels, for which I was given the title of "Quizmaster".
